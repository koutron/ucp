     <div class="content">United for Clean Power was born from a desire to create a strong, unified voice for renewable energy and climate change policy within the United States. UCP believes that a strong energy future must include renewable forms of energy. UCP believes that climate change is a reality that must be addressed through public awareness and bipartisan political will. The organizationâ€™s goal is to create consensus across the political spectrum that supports climate change and renewable energy policies that work to create economic opportunity while building a more resilient and adaptive America.</br></br>
     Build non-partisan support for renewable energy and climate action policies across the United States in order to promote a more secure, sustainable, and clean economy for the American people.

   We aim to reach as many people as possible with non-partisan, educational content that explains these issues.

 <div class="content">At UCP, we believe that every issue requires a balanced approach. Alienating others will not help humanity address the issues of increased drought, lack of fresh water, or rising sea levels. We strive to understand where people are coming from and bring the conversation about these serious issues to them in a non-judgmental or condescending manner. After all, we all want the same thing: access to clean water, food, and security. We all want to thrive and find joy. If we start listening to each other, maybe we can get there.
